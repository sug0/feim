# feim

A modular crate for working with images in the most sought after
language of 2021.

# How to use this mess

For now, I'll be keeping it kind of low key. Insert this
in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
feim = { git = "https://git.sr.ht/~sugo/feim", tag = "v0.7" }
```

You need a nightly toolchain to build this crate, because I'm
using the unstable `specialization` feature.
